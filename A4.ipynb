    "## Motivation & Overview\n",
    "I wanted to conduct this analysis on rock climbing because I find the growing sport to be a fun and creative outlook to problem solve while utilizing physical strength and techniques to finish routes. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, I find that the sport presents risks that are often underestimated. It's also important to recognize that this sport is challenging in terms of both cost and accessibility. As a climber myself, I believe that it's crucial to emphasize the importance of safety and privilege in this space. I wanted to highlight the need to be mindful as we climb, and that even something like injuries can have significant impacts not only on continuing climbing but on their health and well-being outside of the climbing walls. In terms of a human-centered perspective, scientific  and practical perspective, it helps determine the possible risks and dangers to better inform gyms of better safety practices and protocols while climbing. The study would help both climbers and gym owners acknowledge and evaluate common injuries while climbing as a whole, certain grades or routes, or any other precautions. This research could be used to help develop new safety protocols to aid in  injury prevention and is informative to new climbers entering the space. As a climber, I hope to learn the injuries that are sustained s based on a climber's experience level. As someone who has only been consistently climbing for the past year, I've wanted to learn how often climbers of different experiences, are sustaining injuries and learning the effects of outside the gym. It would help me as I progress and move onto higher grade levels, what types of injuries are common, and learn ways how to prevent them.\n"

    "## Research Questions & Hypothesis\n",
    "With the entire project focusing on injuries that are sustained at different experience levels for in-door climbing, research questions such as:\n",
    "- What are the most common injuries sustained at different experience levels for climbers?\n",
    "- What was the recovery process for these climbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions would help gauge the risks that are associated with climbing, especially among climbers with higher experience levels. These questions seek to uncover the injuries that are most commonly sustained for their respective experience level while seeing what kind of impact it has to continue participating in the sport and their overall well-being after the injury. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my hypothesis, I believe that climbers with higher experience levels typically sustain more injuries associated with tendons and/or pulleys compared to climbers with lower levels of experience, and therefore often are more likely to need professional attention to recover from their injuries. My prediction is based on how more experienced climbers have more strain on these muscles, and are more susceptible to injuries as they climb more difficult grades that put more stress on them.\n"

    "## Background in Climbing Injuries\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been research that has been previously conducted before in the past about rock climbing as a sport and injuries that have occurred while climbing. Research from Kovářová, Pyszko, and Kikalová have discovered that injuries from bouldering suffer from more \"upper extremity injuries, particularly affecting the hands, fingers, wrists, and elbows. In lead climbing, a wider array of injuries is observed, ranging from head injuries and shoulder or collarbone injuries to foot-related issues\" (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10892067/). Additionally, we know \"that dedicated climbers participating in different forms of rock climbing frequently and at a higher level of technical difficulty may be more prone to injury\" (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5484453/) \n",
    "\n",
    "While information about injuries sustained when climbing exists, it doesn't consider the aftermath of those injuries. I wanted to address the short/long-term aftermath of these injuries and how they've affected climbers. Injuries are big setbacks for many people in any sport, and in a space where even finger injuries can prevent participation, it's important to understand the potential consequences of these injuries. With the absence of injury aftermath in current research, I wanted to address how this research could help inform gym owners to create better safety protocols and to inform new climbers of risks and prevention when climbing.

    "I wanted to use this data set because it aligns with my research needs, including information from injury type, climber experience level, recovery time, and climbing grades as well. It contains ample depth and a variety of data needed to analyze and draw conclusions about the risks associated with indoor climbing. The dataset provides information that gives us the level at which they typically climb, their experience level, climber demographic, and injury type.

It aligns with my goal to analyze the types of injuries that are associated with climbing and the outcomes of those injuries. A thorough analysis is needed to help inform new safety protocols and practices in indoor climbing.\n",
    "An ethical concern in this data set could be the climber's demographic, such as age and sex. Human bodies change over time and are biologically different influencing different types of injuries andtheirs severity. This could limit the conclusions made about injuries while climbing. Another concern could be informed consent, due to this possibly tying into medical data, there should be verification whether the data that was collected was consented to by participants. Ensuring that they are aware that this data is open and could be shared.."

    "## Methodology \n",
    "To conduct this research, I plan on utilizing a t-test to help analyze the data. I will be comparing the different injuries that are sustained between experienced climbers and new climbers. This would allow me to determine the difference in the types and severity of injuries between groups of climbers. Additionally, I may implement descriptive statistics to help determine the impact of the recovery process such as recovery time, treatment satisfaction, and whether surgical intervention was required. I would utilize an analysis for the most common injury for each level of experience and then utilize descriptive statistics to help showcase the average recovery time and other medical interventions for each level of experience. Descriptive statistics in this instance would help provide a summary of the impacts of these injuries effectively to evaluate any potential trends with certain injuries. \n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the data, I believe that bar plots would be the most effective in communicating the most common injuries for each experience group. Each level of experience (0-1 year, 2-3 years, etc) would receive its own bar graph with the most common injuries that were sustained. After all levels of experience have their graph, a table would be most efficient in labeling the MOST common injury for each level of experience. To help visualize data about post-injury recovery/impact a table would be most sufficient in delivering the data because it would be extremely difficult to cross-label between the different levels of experience along with recovery outcomes due to there being different categories of the recovery process. Labeling it under a table would communicate the results most efficiently as it can show an organized comparison between recovery time, treatment satisfaction, surgical intervention, and other details without overwhelming the user visually. \n"
